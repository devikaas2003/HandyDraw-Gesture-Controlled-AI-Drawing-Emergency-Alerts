# HandyDraw: Gesture Controlled AI Drawing & Emergency Alerts

HandyDraw is an AI-powered, gesture-controlled drawing assistant. Using a webcam and Mediapipe hand tracking, you can:

- Draw on a virtual canvas using your index finger.
- Clear the canvas by showing all five fingers.
- Send an instant WhatsApp emergency message with a unique hand gesture (4 fingers up, 1 down).

This project demonstrates the power of computer vision, gesture recognition, and automation, combining creativity and safety.
